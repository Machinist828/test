How to start the project:

1. Clone it in your local repo with git clone https://github.com/Machinist828/test.git

2. Navigate to the randomnumbers folder

3. open terminal and run "npm install" command to install the required packages.

4. run "ng serve" to start the application

5. Users list is hardcoded, Matches List is hardcoded, and i use services to store data. Note: If you refresh the screen you start all over

6. Once the app is started, in the root component I set expiry date for the matches to be 1min for the upcoming match, 2mins for the next match and so on. So, after 5mins there should be 5 expired matches in the results list
